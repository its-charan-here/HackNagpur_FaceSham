### Problem Statement 

Now a days the AI based technology creates realistic fake images or videos of targeted people by swapping their faces another person saying or doing things that are not actually done by them. This has started creating trust issues and rather than benefiting anyone, this AI-based technology has disadvantages affecting different groups of our society. Apart from creating fake news and propaganda, deepfake is majorly used for revenge, to defame notable celebrities and politicians. 

### Solution
Deepfake detection includes solutions that leverage multi-modal detection techniques to determine whether target media has been manipulated or synthetically generated. Existing detection techniques can be loosely split into manual and algorithmic methods. Manual techniques include human media forensic practitioners, often armed with software tools. Algorithmic detection uses an AI-based algorithm to identify manipulated media.
